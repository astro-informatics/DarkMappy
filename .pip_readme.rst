``darkmappy`` is a lightweight python package which implements the hybrid Bayesian dark-matter reconstruction techniques 
outlined on the plane in `Price et al. 2019 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/506/3/3678/6319513>`_, and on the celestial sphere in `Price et al. 2021 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/500/4/5436/5986632>`_. For comparison (and as initilaisiation for our iterations) the spherical Kaiser-Squires estimator of the convergence is implemented (see `Wallis et al. 2021 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/509/3/4480/6424933>`_). These techniques are based on *maximum a posteriori* estimation which, by construction, support principled uncertainty quantification, see `Pereyra 2016 <https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/16M1071249>`_. Further examples of such uncertainty quantification techniques developed for the weak lensing setting can be found in related articles `Price et al. 2019a <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/489/3/3236/5554769>`_ and `Price et al. 2019b <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/1/394/5672642>`_.

INSTALLATION
============
``darkmappy`` can be installed through PyPi by running 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install darkmappy 

or alternatively from source by running the following 

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/astro-informatics/DarkMappy.git
    cd DarkMappy 
    bash build_darkmappy.sh 

following which the test suite can be executed by running 

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --black darkmappy/tests

BASIC USAGE
===========
For planar reconstructions across the flat-sky the estimator can be run by the following, note that images must be square.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import darkmappy.estimators as dm

    # LOAD YOUR DATA
    data = np.load(<path_to_shear_data>)
    ngal = np.load(<path_to_ngal_per_pixel_map>)
    mask = np.load(<path_to_observation_mask>)

    # BUILD THE ESTIMATOR 
    dm_estimator = dm.DarkMappyPlane(
               n = n,                   # Dimension of image
            data = data,                # Observed shear field
            mask = mask,                # Observational mask
            ngal = ngal,                # Map of number density of observations per pixel
             wav = [<select_wavelets>], # see https://tinyurl.com/mrxeat3t
          levels = level,               # Wavelet levels
     supersample = supersample)         # Super-resolution factor (typically <~2)

    # RUN THE ESTIMATOR
    convergence, diagnostics = dm_estimator.run_estimator()

For spherical reconstructions across the full-sky the estimator can be run by the following, note images must be of dimension L by 2L-1, see `McEwen & Wiaux 2011 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6006544>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import darkmappy.estimators as dm

    # LOAD YOUR DATA
    data = np.load(<path_to_shear_data>)
    ngal = np.load(<path_to_ngal_per_pixel_map>)
    mask = np.load(<path_to_observation_mask>)

    # BUILD THE ESTIMATOR
    dm_estimator = dm.DarkMapperSphere(
               L = L,             # Angular Bandlimit    
               N = N,             # Azimuthal Bandlimit (wavelet directionality)
            data = data,          # Observational shear data
            mask = mask,          # Observation mask
            ngal = ngal)          # Map of number density of observations per pixel
    
    # RUN THE ESTIMATOR 
    convergence, diagnostics = dm_estimator.run_estimator()
